     * By default, Spring uses a local single-threaded scheduler to run the tasks. As a result, even if we have
     * multiple @Scheduled methods, they each need to wait for the thread to complete executing a previous task.
     * If our tasks are truly independent, itâ€™s more convenient to run them in parallel. For that, we need to
     * provide a TaskScheduler that better suits our needs.
